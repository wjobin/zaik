In the center of the room stands an altar of black stone, covered in melted candle wax and strange markings. The air is freezing cold, and your breath mists before you. \n\nAs you stand there, you hear it - a slow, rhythmic sound echoing through the chamber. Footsteps. Something is approaching from the darkness beyond...\n\nYour adventure continues, but this is where our story ends for now.",
